# VGR-Bot
This is a Discord bot that gives a random video game recommendation by using the Discord API and RAWG.io database API.
The goal of this project was to better understand how to implement API's and create a fun game suggester for my friends.

## Deployment Instructions
 - Create a .env file with your discord key, discord server name, and RAWG API key
 - Change line 51 to contain your channel ID
 - Run the bot with py bot.py
